"""Creates a random number between low and high."""

:usage: `int randrange_R(int low, int high)`
:usage: `float randrange_R(float low, float high)`

theoretically speaking, low <= number <= high
Create by cpp11 std random_device.
If keep returning 1, you are using it incorrectly.

:usage: `int rand(float seed, int low, int high)`
:usage: `float rand(float seed, float low, float high)`

theoretically speaking, low <= number < high
Create by SYSsrand48 and SYSdrand48.
