:usage: `float linelineintersect_R(vector line0_pos0, vector line0_pos1, vector line1_pos0, vector line1_pos1, vector &intersect_pos0, vector &intersect_pos1)`

This function returns a value which indicates how close to being parallel the lines are. Closer to zero means more parallel.
This is done so that the user of thisfunction can decide what epsilon they want to use.
